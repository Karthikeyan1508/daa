# Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a widely used comparison-based sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. The algorithm divides the unsorted list into two halves recursively until each sublist consists of only one element. Then, it merges these sublists in a sorted manner. The key step is the merge operation, where two sorted sublists are combined to form a single sorted list.

Merge Sort is known for its stability, meaning that the relative order of equal elements remains unchanged. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) for the worst, average, and best cases, making it efficient for large datasets. Additionally, Merge Sort is often preferred for its predictable performance and adaptability to linked lists. Despite its relatively higher space complexity due to the auxiliary arrays used during merging.
